Prediction of Ruthenium metal price based on future date
Rare metals are known to increase in value in times of crisis as evidenced by the current global pandemic and previous world events. One of the rare metals is called Ruthenium.
Although it is a known fact that predicting future prices of such metals is a complicated science that must take into consideration lots of factors (economical, political, mines discovery, .. etc), for this task, a small and limited data is offered to work on which is the monthly prices of the rare metal starting from July 1992.

The built application is based on linear regression model where the user is able to enter a future date and receive the forecasted price of Ruthenium as a response. The model is trained on 80% of the data, and then it is tested with the rest. The model is based on three features which are the day, month, and year. The predicted output is the price of Ruthenium. 

To run the application, you download the Python 3 notebook named Prediction of Ruthenium price.ipynb along with the dataset that is named Ruthenium_Prices.csv (Both files must be in the same directory)
Run all the cells.
The user will notified to enter the desired date in a specific format.
When entering the date, the model will predict the price and will output it to the user.
